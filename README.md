**Please add the Attendees Information csv file to the root before launching `scripts.py`**



This is a script to scan the QR code, match information from the csv, then generate pdf and print the pdf.

The outputs are stored under folder 'generated_pdfs'

---
You might need to set up some packages to run the script
```python
pip install pdf2image # for test function

```

Remark: Haven't tested the webcam and the print party. Test with provided qr-code passed.

Feel free to write here whatever you think of :)
